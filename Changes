Revision history

0.06
	- Re-organized many internal functions to better manage memmory and free up memory no longer used
	  sooner.
	- Added new method clients() to return the list of clients or number of clients connected to a
	  server.
	- Modified the new() constructor to accept a "Welcome" message visible by telnetting into a server.


0.05
	- Fixed a bug where calling the receive() method may have failed if a signal (such as child dying)
	  was delivered to the process at the same time.  The bug became apparent on heavily-stormed
	  servers with many forked() children dying, causing the negotiation with new clients to sometimes
	  fail.
	- Re-wrote the server-side negotiating code to prevent it from blocking for couple of seconds during
	  negotiating with a newly connected client.


0.04
	- Fixed a bug where older versions of Crypt::CBC were not called correctly causing "make test"
	  and almost everything else to fail.
	- Minor changes to the protocol negotiation


0.03
	- Added encryption support for Crypt::DES_EDE3, Crypt::DES and Crypt::Blowfish
	- Added 2 new methods to determine what type of compression and encryption has been negotiated.


0.02
	- Implemented transparent compression
	- Implemented transparent encryption
	- Internal protocol majorly re-designed to accomodate new and future features
	- Re-wrote the test routine to use fork() and simulate a real-world scenario
	- Minor bugfixes in receive()
